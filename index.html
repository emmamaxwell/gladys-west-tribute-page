    <h3 id="headline">Timeline of Important Events in Her Life</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1930</strong> - born in a rural county south of Richmond, Virginia to an African American farming family in a community of sharecroppers</li>
      <li><strong>1948</strong> - graduated from her high school as valedictorian</li>
      <li><strong>1952</strong> - graduated from Virginia State College (now University) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics</li>
      <li><strong>1955</strong> - graduated with her Master of Mathematics degree from VSU, after teaching math and science for two years</li>
      <li><strong>1956</strong> - began working as a programmer with computers and systems used in the analysis of satellite data at the Naval Proving Ground (now the Naval Surface Warfare Center) in Dahlgren, Virginia; she was only the 2nd Black woman to be hired and 1 of only 4 Black employees at the time</li>
      <li><strong>1960s</strong> - participated in award-winning astronomical study that proved the regularity of Pluto’s motion relative to Neptune, began analyzing data from satellites and putting together altimeter models of the Earth's shape, and became project manager for the Seasat radar altimetry project (the first satellite that could remotely sense oceans)</li>
      <li><strong>1970s</strong> - programmed an IBM computer to deliver increasingly precise calculations to model the shape of the Earth which required her to employ complex algorithms to account for variations in gravitational, tidal, and other forces that distort Earth's shape; this data ultimately became the basis for the Global Positioning System (GPS)</li>
      <li><strong>1979</strong> - recommended for commendation after cutting her team’s processing time in half and consistently putting in extra hours</li>
      <li><strong>1986</strong> - published <i>Data Processing System Specifications for the Geosat Satellite Radar Altimeter</i>, a 51-page technical report from The Naval Surface Weapons Center (NSWC)</li>
      <li><strong>1998</strong> - retired in 1998 after working at Dahlgren for 42 years, went on to complete a PhD in Public Administration from Virginia Tech</li>
      <li><strong>2018</strong> - inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame and selected by the BBC as part of their 100 Women of 2018</li>
